<summary><strong>ðŸ“˜ Short Summary of Thesis</strong></summary>

Brainwaves present a compelling avenue for secure person authentication because they are inherently unobservable externally and capable of facilitating liveness detection. Harnessing brainwaveâ€™s unique and individualistic attributes, they have found extensive utility in various authentication applications. Nonetheless, the domain of brainwave authentication research has witnessed an upsurge in diverse experimental setups and the meticulous fine-tuning of parameters to optimize authentication methodologies. The substantial diversity in their methods poses a significant obstacle in assessing and measuring authentic research advancements. 

To address this multifaceted issue, this thesis introduces a versatile and robust benchmarking framework tailored explicitly for brainwave authentication systems. This framework draws upon the resources of four publicly accessible medical-grade brainwave datasets. It is worth mentioning that our study encompasses a substantial sample size consisting of 195 participants. The number of participants in our study is noteworthy, particularly when compared to the customary approach in brainwave authentication research, which typically involves a participant pool about one-fifth the size of our study.

Our extensive assessment encompassed a variety of state-of-the-art authentication algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, and advanced deep learning methods like Siamese Neural Networks. Our evaluation approach incorporated both within-session (single-session) and cross-session (multi-session) analysis, covering threat cases like close-set (seen attacker) and open-set (unseen attacker) scenarios to ensure the toolâ€™s versatility in different contexts. 

In within-session evaluation, our framework showcased outstanding performance for several classifiers, particularly Siamese Networks, which achieved an Equal Error Rate of 1.60% in the unseen attacker scenario. Additionally, our benchmarking frameworkâ€™s adaptability is a notable asset, allowing researchers to tailor pre-processing, feature extraction, and authentication parameters to suit their specific requirements.

Launch the automation Script: 

Launch the python file run.py
with command "python run.py". This python file will internally automation script benchmark.py. The  script parses the above configuration file and streamlines all the tasks related to data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification for a single dataset. It conducts benchmarking assessments across multiple
classifiers for the specified dataset

# Benchmarking Architecture and Main Concepts

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/Architecture.png" alt="Architecture" width="800" height="380">
</div>

There are four main concepts for this framework: datasets, paradigm, pipeline, Evalaution. Furthermore, 
we provide statistical and visualization tools to streamline the process.

## Datasets: 

This module offers abstract access to open datasets. It entails downloading open datasets from the internet and 
providing effective data management.

## PreProcesing: 

The purpose of this module is to conduct pre-processing on the unprocessed EEG data. 
Datasets exhibit distinct characteristics based on ERP paradigms such as P300 and N400. Nevertheless, both conditions 
elicit ERP responses after the individualâ€™s exposure to unexpected stimuli. Consequently, the datasets for the P300 
and N400 paradigms undergo pre-processing using identical parameters.

## FeatureExtraction: 

This module extracts features from data that has been pre-processed. These characteristics are extracted in the time 
domain using Auto Regressive Coeffecients and in the frequency domain using Power Spectral Density. Furthermore, this module
also provides Siamese Network Architecture.  

## Evaluations: 

Evaluation defines the different authentication strategy which involves within-session(single session recordings) evalaution 
and cross-session (multi-session recordings) evalaution under both close-set and open-set attack scenarios. 
Results for within-session and cross-session are presented with metrics like EER, AUC, FRR at 1% FAR.

## Analysis

Once an evaluation has been run, the raw results are returned as a DataFrame. The results such as ROC-Curve or EER can be 
visualized by calling functions from this module. 


# How to Add new EEG data for benchmarking?

Reserachers can utilize this tool to perform benchmarking and evalaute their approach. 
However,there are certain pre-requisities that need to be fuflfilled to add new EEG data to this tool.
Following steps needs to be followed to add new EEG data.

1. Convert the raw EEG data into standarized MNE raw object(mne.io.Raw). MNE is a powerful Python package and capable to reading and 
    converting any EEG format into MNE format. Some of the tutorials for converting EEG data into standarized MNE format
    can be found at https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/io/index.html. 

2. Once the raw EEG data is converted into mne. Save the state of MNE object into .fif format. 
    The mne data should be saved in hierarchy of folders like "sujectID"--> "Sesssion number" --> "Run number" --> EEG_data.fif.
    For example: Assume an EEG dataset comprises of 2 subjects. Each subject has performed EEG task across 2 sessions
    and each session contains two runs. Then the mne data should be saved in the following ways: 

    <b>Subject 1</b>: 
    "Subject_1" --> "Session_1" --> "Run_1" --> EEG_data.fif, 
    "Subject_1" --> "Session_2" --> EEG_data.fif 

    <b>Subject</b>:
    "Subject_2" --> "Session_1" --> "Run_1" --> EEG_data.fif, 
    "Subject_2" --> "Session_2" --> "Run_1" --> EEG_data.fif 

3. Edit the single_dataset.yml with the below configurations:

Benchamrking pipeline for User i.e., Reseracher's own MNE data with traditional and deep learning methods

```bash
name: "User"

dataset: 
  - name: UserDataset
    from: brainModels.datasets
    parameters: 
      dataset_path: '/Users/avinashkumarchaurasia/mne_data/New_data/dataset'
    
pipelines:

  "AR+PSD+SVM": 
    - name: AutoRegressive
      from: brainModels.featureExtraction
      parameters: 
        order: 6
        
    - name: PowerSpectralDensity
      from: brainModels.featureExtraction
        
    - name: SVC
      from: sklearn.svm
      parameters: 
        kernel: 'rbf'
        class_weight: "balanced"
        probability: True

  "TNN": 
    - name : TwinNeuralNetwork
      from: brainModels.featureExtraction
      parameters: 
        EPOCHS: 10
        batch_size: 256
        verbose: 1
        workers: 1

  
  "AR+PSD+RF": 
  - name: AutoRegressive
    from: brainModels.featureExtraction
    parameters: 
      order: 6
    
  - name: PowerSpectralDensity
    from: brainModels.featureExtraction
      
  - name: RandomForestClassifier
  
    from: sklearn.ensemble
    parameters: 
        class_weight: "balanced"
```

This benchmarking pipeline reads the MNE data from the custom path "/Users/avinashkumarchaurasia/mne_data/Matin/dataset".
and create a dataset instance. Afterwards, the pipeline consisiting of traditional algorithm such as SVM and 
deep learning method like Siamese Neural Networks is made.  

4. Launch the python file run.py from terminal which has a main method and internally calls the automation script for benchmark.py 


# How to integrate researchers customized siamese neural network into the tool?

Reserachers can also evaluate their own approach of Siamese Neural Network(SNN). This benchmarking tool
faciliates the reserachers to write their own customized SNN method in a python file, store it locally
on the machine. This tool imports the researcher method during the run time and trains and test the EEG
data with their SNN method. Following are some of the steps that need to be followed in order to integrate 
reserachers method.

1.  Create python file, imports all the necessary tensorflow packages, and then write a function which
    accepts two parameters. First parameter is "number of channels in EEG data" and second is 
    "time points". The function should be names "_siamese_embeddings" and returns the model which converts the
    high dimensional EEG data into compact brain embeddings. 
    Below is an example of siamese function that can be written in a .py file. 

```bash
import tensorflow as tf
from keras import backend as K
from keras.constraints import max_norm
from keras.layers import (
    Input, Dense, Activation, Lambda, Reshape, BatchNormalization,
  LeakyReLU, Flatten, Dropout, Add,
  MaxPooling1D, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, GlobalAveragePooling2D, AveragePooling2D)
from keras.models import Sequential, Model, load_model, save_model
from keras.callbacks import LearningRateScheduler
from keras.optimizers import Adam
import tensorflow_addons as tfa
import tensorflow_addons as tfa
from tensorflow_addons.losses import TripletSemiHardLoss
  
# # Make a function for siamese network embeddings with triplet loss function
def _siamese_embeddings(no_channels, time_steps):

  activef="selu"
  chn=no_channels
  sn=time_steps

  input = tf.keras.layers.Input((chn, sn, 1))
  x = tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(1, 2))(input)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, (1, 15), activation=activef, kernel_initializer='lecun_normal')(input)
  x = tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(1, 2))(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)
  #x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(1, 4))(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (1, 15), activation=activef, kernel_initializer='lecun_normal')(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(1, 2))(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)
  #x = keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(1, 5))(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (1, 15), activation=activef, kernel_initializer='lecun_normal')(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(1,2))(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(8, (1, 15), activation=activef, kernel_initializer='lecun_normal')(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(1,2))(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(4, (1, 15), activation=activef, kernel_initializer='lecun_normal')(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(1,2))(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)
  x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
  x = tf.keras. layers.Dense(32, activation=None, kernel_initializer='lecun_normal')(x)
  embedding_network = tf.keras.Model(input, x, name="Embedding")
  embedding_network.compile(
  optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
  loss=tfa.losses.TripletSemiHardLoss(margin=1.0))
  embedding_network.summary()
  return embedding_network
  
```

This function is written inside a .py named "siamese_method.py" and stored locally anywhere on the machine.

2. Edit the single_dataset.yml with the below configurations:

Benchamrking pipeline for User i.e., Reseracher's own customized method for Siamese Neural Network

```bash
name: "ERPCORE400"

dataset: 
  - name: ERPCOREN400
    from: brainModels.datasets
    parameters: 
      subjects: 10
      interval: [-0.1, 0.9]
      rejection_threshold: 200


pipelines:

  "TNN": 
    - name : TwinNeuralNetwork
      from:  brainModels.featureExtraction
      parameters: 
        user_tnn_path: "/scratch/hpc-prf-bbam/avinashk/mne_data/User_method/siamese_method.py"
        EPOCHS: 10
        batch_size: 256
        verbose: 1
        workers: 1
```

In the above configuration, user_siamese_path is the path to python file containing the customized Siamse method.
This benchmarking pipeline performs benchmarking on EEG data of ERPCOREN400 with the researchers customized 
Siamese method. If the reseracher has its own EEG data, then they can follow the instructions mentioned in the above section
to add new EEG data and then can evaulate their EEG data on their own Siamese method.

4. Launch the python file run.py from terminal which has a main method and internally calls the automation script benchmark.py.
