## Abstract: 
Brainwaves present a compelling avenue for secure person authentication because they are inherently unobservable externally and capable of facilitating liveness detection. Harnessing brainwave’s unique and individualistic attributes, they have found extensive utility in various authentication applications. Nonetheless, the domain of brainwave authentication research has witnessed an upsurge in diverse experimental setups and the meticulous fine-tuning of parameters to optimize authentication methodologies. The substantial diversity in their methods poses a significant obstacle in assessing and measuring authentic research advancements. To address this multifaceted issue, this thesis introduces a versatile and robust benchmarking framework tailored explicitly for brainwave authentication systems. This framework draws upon the resources of four publicly accessible medical-grade brainwave datasets. It is worth mentioning that our study encompasses a substantial sample size consisting of 195 participants. The number of participants in our study is noteworthy, particularly when compared to the customary approach in brainwave authentication research, which typically involves a participant pool about one-fifth the size of our study. Our extensive assessment encompassed a variety of state-of-the-art authentication algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, and advanced deep learning methods like Siamese Neural Networks. Our evaluation approach incorporated both withinsession (single-session) and cross-session (multi-session) analysis, covering threat cases like close-set (seen attacker) and open-set (unseen attacker) scenarios to ensure the tool’s versatility in different contexts. In within-session evaluation, our framework showcased outstanding performance for several classifiers, particularly Siamese Networks, which achieved an Equal Error Rate of 1.60% in the unseen attacker scenario. Additionally, our benchmarking framework’s adaptability is a notable asset, allowing researchers to tailor pre-processing, feature extraction, and authentication parameters to suit their specific requirements.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
